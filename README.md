# FIS-assignment-2
During A1 you should have created an XML file that describes an order.

For the A2, you have to create a mysql database. The database should have at least 3 tables: i) products, ii) orders and iii) customers. One customer may have several orders s/he has made. An order should contain at least one product. A product can be in three possible states - ordered, in_production, manufactured and shipped. 
Using Node.js, create a web interface to the database. The interface should allow to make SELECT requests to the database. In particular, the user should be able to check:

* what products were made so far?
* list order history for a customer?
* list products that are being currently in production?
* list customers, whose products are currently in production?
* list customers, who were ordering something last week?



The tables should be populated by you in order to demonstrate requested queries. You can populate tables using directly SQL commands or allowing INSERT and UPDATE commands to be passed over the web interface to the database.



The assignment can be done in the group of max 3 students.
